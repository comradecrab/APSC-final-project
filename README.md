Tinkercad Simon Says game

// I was able to program the LEDs to flash a) randomly, using a random seed function that then copied randomly generated numbers within a range
    to an array that were assigned to specific LEDs and b) have this sequence begin at n=1 and increase with each repeat until n=5 was reached
